# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a small single file game of Tic-Tac-Toe in python that takes user input in the terminal in order to play the game. The terminal syntax is to choose a position from 1-9 (top right box is 9, bottom left box is 1, just like your numberpad on your keyboard). Here is an example: >>9.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  (7) | (8)  | (9)

  (4) | (5)  | (6)

  (1) | (2)  | (3)

# Tic-Tac-Toe future features and stuff in the works
Now, this is a work in prgress and isn't complete. There is still some bugs that need to be worked out and if possible, after I work out all of the bugs and get a good solid product, I would like to add some kind of simple auto play mode so the user can play the computer, and after that I may add a menu to the beginning of the program so a user can play another user or the computer and set the difficulty.
