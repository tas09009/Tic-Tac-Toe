# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a small single file game of Tik-Tac-Toe in python that takes user input in the terminal in order to play the game. The terminal syntax is one character (X or O), space, and a position from 1-9 (top left box is 1, bottom right box is 9). Here is an example: >> x 9.

# Tic-Tac-Toe future features and stuff in the works
Now, this is a work in prgress and isn't complete. There is still some bugs that need to be worked out and if possible, after I work out all of the bugs and get a good solid product, I would like to add some kind of simple auto play mode so the user can play the computer, and after that I may add a menu to the beginning of the program so a user can play another user or the computer and set the difficulty.
